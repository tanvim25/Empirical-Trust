Empirical-Trust
===============

Overall, I this proposal is well done.

I believe the primary challenge will be in normalizing the activities and activity levels between different users when doing the expert analysis.

Additionally, I think one worthwhile output would be to use some of your insights into what makes an expert an expert and determine instances where someone who *should not* have answered a question got voted up higher than an actual expert and vice versa.
